			have help from two autonomous agents. You do not need to do anything when you find a victim or a 
			hazard, the system will record your exploration as you move.

			Use the arrow keys or awsd (or hjkl if you're a vim power user) to control the human. After every 30 seconds, you will be shown the images of 
			the current state of the whole map, the human explored area, and the agent explored area. You will be prompted 
			to either integrate or discard both agents' explored regions (Agent 1 and Agent 2). If you choose to integrate, the agent explored region 
			(shaded green/orange) will turn red. If you choose to discard this area, the green/orange colored region will disappear and is 
			considered unexplored.
